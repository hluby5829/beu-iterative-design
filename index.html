            <h1>BeU Iterative Design</h1>
            <p>BeU delivery is an on-demand food delivery service in Africa similar to DoorDash or UberEats.
                They are the #1 food delivery service in Ethiopia, 67% cheaper than the competition, with plans
                to expand their services to new markets and eventually become the super APP of Africa.
            </p>
            <p>Our group is designing a mobile interface for beU because we felt that a lot of users would be
                interacting with the application on their phones as is typical from DoorDash and UberEats users.
                Users who would be impacted are those with slow wifi speeds or low data left in their monthly plans.
                PLEASE ADD MORE RORISENNA!!

            <h1>Sketching and Wireframes</h1>
            <p>Eastside Marketplace is a grocery store located just east of Brown campus and frequented
                by many members of the community including students. You can check out their current
                website below.

                        <h2>Usability</h2>
                        <li>Link to directions is a hidden button with white text with no other
                            way to see the store location

                        <li>No breadcrumbs or back button to get to previous pages</li>
                        <li>Navbar is crowded but also doesn't link to all pages, making it even harder to figure out
                            where some pages are located in different sections of site</li>

                    <ul>
                        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                        <li>Most images on the front page are missing alt text</li>
                        <li>Buttons are hidden from view until hovered over</li>
                        <li>Text color contrast is low, making it hard to read</li>
                        <li>Interactable buttons are not highlighted when tabbing through the page, in fact some parts
                            of
                            the home page are completely inaccessible using tab</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After running the site through WebAIM WAVE, it pointed out things like missing alt text
                and empty divs that I otherwise would not have noticed. These
                things are essential for people who rely on screen readers to navigate through the site and
                must be present for a website to be considered truly accessible.
            </p>
            <p>However, there were some things that WAVE missed. For example, there are some hidden buttons with white
                or
                neon yellow text that are completely unnoticeable on first glance at the site. The contrast must be
                higher
                on these buttons since they pose an accessibility risk.

            <h1>Designs</h1>
            <p>Using the information I gathered from Usability and Accessibilty testing, I went into remedying any
                problems
                with a few Lofo-Wireframes of different device sizes.
            </p>
            <h2>Lofi-Wireframes</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Desktop</h3>
                    <img class="empathy-map" src="./assets/Desktop.jpg">
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Tablet</h3>
                    <img class="empathy-map" src="./assets/Tablet.jpg">

            </div>
            <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
            <p>Next, I moved on to a redesign of buttons, icons, and the navbar. Many of the original buttons were
                hard to find and didn't offer much in the form of text color contrast. The original navbar gave no
                indication of which tab you were in, now the current tab is highlighted. I also fiddled around with the
                idea of incorporating a light and dark mode toggle, which is common for modern websites.

            <h2>Hifi-Wireframes</h2>
            <p>With these designs in mind, I was able to create the components for my Hifi-Prototypes of the site on
                desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>Since all sections of the design follow a scrolling layout, I decided to use
                Bootstrap grid instead of flex box.
                This allows us to easily set built in break points for different screen sizes.
