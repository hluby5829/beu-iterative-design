            <h1>Eastside Market Redesign</h1>
            <p>In this age of information where people turn to Google to look up anything about
                everything, the first interaction people have with a business is usually through their website. Now more
                than ever, it is crucial for businesses to have well-designed websites that are aesthetically pleasing
                and work on many types of devices and screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>This project aims to redesign the Eastside Marketplace website to be more
                accessible and responsive to screen resizing while preserving the overall information
                contained in the original site.

            <h1>Current Website</h1>
            <p>Eastside Marketplace is a grocery store located just east of Brown campus and frequented
                by many members of the community including students. You can check out their current
                website below.

                        <h2>Usability</h2>
                        <li>Link to directions is a hidden button with white text with no other
                            way to see the store location
                        </li>
                        <li>Link target inconsistencies (some open new tabs some don't)</li>
                        <li>No breadcrumbs or back button to get to previous pages</li>
                        <li>Navbar is crowded but also doesn't link to all pages, making it even harder to figure out
                            where some pages are located in different sections of site</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                        <li>Most images on the front page are missing alt text</li>
                        <li>Buttons are hidden from view until hovered over</li>
                        <li>Text color contrast is low, making it hard to read</li>
                        <li>Interactable buttons are not highlighted when tabbing through the page, in fact some parts
                            of
                            the home page are completely inaccessible using tab</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After running the site through WebAIM WAVE, it pointed out things like missing alt text
                and empty divs that I otherwise would not have noticed. These
                things are essential for people who rely on screen readers to navigate through the site and
                must be present for a website to be considered truly accessible.
            </p>
            <p>However, there were some things that WAVE missed. For example, there are some hidden buttons with white
                or
                neon yellow text that are completely unnoticeable on first glance at the site. The contrast must be
                higher
                on these buttons since they pose an accessibility risk.

            <h1>Designs</h1>
            <p>Using the information I gathered from Usability and Accessibilty testing, I went into remedying any
                problems
                with a few Lofo-Wireframes of different device sizes.
            </p>
            <h2>Lofi-Wireframes</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Desktop</h3>
                    <img class="empathy-map" src="./assets/Desktop.jpg">
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Tablet</h3>
                    <img class="empathy-map" src="./assets/Tablet.jpg">

                <div class="col">

                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
            <p>Next, I moved on to a redesign of buttons, icons, and the navbar. Many of the original buttons were
                hard to find and didn't offer much in the form of text color contrast. The original navbar gave no
                indication of which tab you were in, now the current tab is highlighted. I also fiddled around with the
                idea of incorporating a light and dark mode toggle, which is common for modern websites.

            <h2>Hifi-Wireframes</h2>
            <p>With these designs in mind, I was able to create the components for my Hifi-Prototypes of the site on
                desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>Since all sections of the design follow a scrolling layout, I decided to use
                Bootstrap grid instead of flex box.
                This allows us to easily set built in break points for different screen sizes.
