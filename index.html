        <p>
          BeU delivery is an on-demand food delivery service in Africa similar
          to DoorDash or UberEats. They are the #1 food delivery service in
          Ethiopia, 67% cheaper than the competition, with plans to expand their
          services to new markets and eventually become the super APP of Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group is designing a mobile interface for BeU because we felt that
          most users would be interacting with the application on their
          phones similar to DoorDash and UberEats. Currently a majority of the 
          Ethiopian population lacks internet, with only 20.6%  
          surveyed to have consistent internet access in 2021. Furthermore mobile 
          devicecs occupy the primary market share in Ethiopia with the breakdown
          being 63.24% Mobile, 34.29% Desktop, and 2.3% Tablet. This is why
          a mobile prototype seemed the most viable option for our group.

        <h1>Sketching</h1>
        <p>After reading the description of the BeU mission, we came up with a few
            sketches that we thought achieved the startup's goal. Each person in our
            group came up with 3 frames each.

        <h1>Wireframe</h1>
        <p>After some deliberation, we picked the best aspects of all of our designs
            and came up with a few wireframes to get a rough idea of our final design.

          <li>"It would be helpful to have a dropdown button to read more on the restaurant page to read the rest of the description"</li>
          <li>"Iâ€™d put the user profile picture in the nav bar in the bottom right corner instead of the generic icon"</li>
          <li>"There are a lot of inconsistent fonts and weights used"</li>

          After receiving critiques from our classsmates, we began iterating and improving our prototype. Above are some examples
          of critiques we received that were then fixed in our current version. They allowed us to provide a more user friendly prototype
          that better encapsulated what we hoped to accomplish.

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>Overall...</p>

        <ul>
          <li>User #3 was also appreciative of the deals being front and center on the homescreen.</li>
          <li>For the first subtask, some mentioned how easy it was to navigate 
            the app and commented on how useful certain features were (time to 
            deliver and rows for "Popular Restaurants", "Favorite Restaurants",
            "Order Again", etc.)</li>
          <li>Most users noticed how not everything was interactable which 
            confused them as they tried to get to a specific restaurant page.</li>
          <li>Many of the user testers noticed a few issues we overlooked such as missing a picture for one of our restaurants, and missing some text on another one.</li>
          <li>They also noted how useful it would be to have a menu bar at the 
            top of the restaurant page to quickly navigate to the entrees section 
            or drinks section.</li>
          <li>The user testers universally enjoyed the friends feature, and were excited at the future possibilities for it.</li>
          <li>Many were saddened at the lack of ability to use a drop down to read more about a restaurants information.</li>
          <li>They pointed out a general appreciation for all 
            the information on a restaurants page such as: rating, hours, and menu.</li>
